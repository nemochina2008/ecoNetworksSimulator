# Sprint 001 Build trophic model

* Started: 2016-07-08
* Ends: 2016-07-15

## Problem

We need to be able to build simple trophic models.

We would also like to run them using both the crude Euler and rather more 
refined fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods.

Finally we would like to be able to output the current trophic model as a 
set of differential equations in a LaTeX format.
